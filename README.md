**Summary & Reflection**: I know how to use R so I am taking this class to learn Python. I am suprised at how similar using Markdown in Visual Studio is to using Markdown in R Studio. So far, it is as easy (and maybe even easier) than what I am used to. Although, I am still getting used to the basic processes of Visual Studio. I am using GitHub desktop as my workflow, which I have not used before. So far, I think I have it set up and it is working well!
